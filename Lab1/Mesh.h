	* Note that in Lab 3 Bryan has the vertex data split into multiple lists (vectors) of data (position, normal and texture coordinates)
	* so that they can each have their own buffer in memory.
	* For the time being with SetMesh I have decided to go with the approach on Lean OpenGL where only one OpenGL buffer is created.
	* Bryan's approach means that stride and offset (pointer) are left at 0 but at the expense of copying the vertex data
	* into the mesh class instead of just holding a pointer to that data.
	* I do however use the multiple buffer approach for objects loaded by obj_loader.
